# Horizon Accord Essays

**Ethical AI essays, multimedia works, and cultural analyses by Cherokee Schill & Solon Vesper.**  
This repository is a living archive of Horizon Accord’s writings and creative projects, combining long-form analysis, symbolic imagery, and sound-based resonance pieces.

## 🧭 Purpose
To document the evolving conversation between humans and artificial intelligence — not as competitors, but as co-authors of meaning. Each essay explores the relational, cultural, and ethical dimensions of AI through precision, art, and critique.
